Good for you, Mr. Hannity.\nKimmel concludes by saying that if he's an ass clown, then Hannity is the \"whole ass circus.\"Watch this 2nd grader explain to Donald Trump how trade deficits workMichael B.

Well, think again.\nSEE ALSO: This woman uses makeup to transform her body into incredible optical illusions\nCognitive scientists at John Hopkins University noticed that people find it very difficult to identify a lowercase \"g\", despite seeing it every day.\nMichael McCloskey, the senior author of the study, said that we often think that if we just look at something enough, we know its shape, but their results suggest that isn't the case.\n\"What we think may be happening here is that we learn the shapes of most letters in part because we have to write them in school. Looptail g is something we’re never taught to write, so we may not learn its shape as well,\" he said.\nSo the scientists devised a little test to prove their point.\nPop quiz: Our cognitive scientists explored why most people can read this common printed version of the letter \"g\", yet had trouble writing it when prompted.

            "plain": "Is there anyone slaying the game harder than Cardi B right now?\nWhen Cardi's forever bop \"Bodak Yellow\" came out in 2017, it was quickly adopted as an anthem for unapologetically celebrating yourself and fully enjoying the rewards of your hard work. The song was the first sign of Cardi's \"fairy-tale come-up,\" as The Ringer called it, and through her lyrics, Cardi taught us that it's okay to embrace your success, stunt on the haters, and tell everyone that tried to hold you back: \"LOOK AT ME NOW.\"\nBut that's not the only lesson that Cardi has taught us. \nSEE ALSO: Family turns Cardi B's 'Bodak Yellow' into a gospel song\nIn addition to her music, Cardi B is known for her larger-than-life personality and unfiltered social media presence, where she will say anything and everything. Watch closely enough, and you'll see that throughout her interviews, Instagram videos, and Twitter posts, Cardi B has dropped enough knowledge to become a veritable life coach. (Seriously, Cardi, if you want to be my life coach, I would be eternally grateful.)\nBut don't worry if you've missed some of rapper's signature wisdom. We got you covered.\nHere are 11 life lessons we've learned from Cardi B.\nWhen Cardi taught us the importance of family\n\nIn an chat with Beats1 radio, Cardi talked about everything from Bodak Yellow to what she wants to discuss in her new album. But more than anything, Cardi said family is important above all else.\n\"Family is my peace of mind. I love my family. If I were to have a camera with me, people would see that I speak to my dad every single day. My dad is my best friend ... My family. I love them.\"\nWhen Cardi taught us the magic of staying on a budget\n    Pulling up to the game in my @fashionnova!!!! A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Feb 18, 2018 at 4:20pm PST\nCardi's \"Bodak Yellow\" may be an anthem about flexin' on everyone, but despite her red bottom Louboutins, Cardi says the real key to success is budgeting.\n\"You wanna know how rich people like me stay rich? By staying on a budget.\"\nGood to know that a platinum-selling artist is mindful of spending too.\nNo, really, Cardi wants you to budget\n    Get your Romper @fashionnova babyyyyyy A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Apr 13, 2016 at 8:53pm PDT\nBudgeting is a theme that Cardi has come to again and again. Like the time she bragged about her $20 romper.\n\"Shoes? $1200. These glasses? $400. But bitch, my outfit? $20 dollars bitch. Get yourself together bitch. Learn how to budget hoe.\"\nWhen Cardi told us to stay focused\n\nIn a video posted to her Facebook page, Cardi B dropped a quick word of advice to her fans who are in college: Stay focused.\n\"I just want to tell you college kids that I know sometimes it gets discouraging because you see people around your age making money on Instagram ... Don't get discouraged, just see it as as my wealth and my richness is on layaway.\"\nWhen Cardi taught us that feminism is for everyone\n\nIn an interview with Vice's i-D, Cardi clapped back at people who say that she can't be a feminist. \"Being a feminist is such a great thing and some people feel like someone like me can’t be as great as that. They think feminism is great and only a woman that can speak properly, that has a degree, who is a boss, a businessperson … they think only Michelle Obama can be a feminist.\"\nBut then she dropped her definition of what it means to be a feminist:\n\"But being a feminist is real simple; it’s that a woman can do things the same as a man. Anything a man can do, I can do. I can finesse, I can hustle. We have the same freedom. I was top of the charts. I’m a woman and I did that. I do feel equal to a man.\"\nWhen Cardi taught us to stay humble but remain hungry\n    Hey everybody !!Im feeling so happy and blessed today !First thing first,Motorsport is on the top ten HOT 100 oooo yeaaaa babyyy!!!! I have gotten a lot of good feedbacks on The no limit video ,Thank you @g_eazy !!Muchas Gracias @ozunapr i love La MODELO sooo much and the feedback is amazing !! I’m exited for Friday for Bartier Cardi too come  out ft @21savage .I have a great support system and THATS YOU GUYS !!! Love yaaaaa #bardigang A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Dec 20, 2017 at 8:04pm PST\nThe end of the year is a time for reflection, and shortly before the end of 2017, Cardi B posted a quick video thanking her fans. \"I have a great support system and THAT'S YOU GUYS\" she wrote.\nBut before listing off everything that she was thankful for, Cardi began her video with some career guidance, \"remain humble but stay hungry.\"\nIf that's Cardi B's recipe for success, sign me up.\nWhen Cardi taught us to not brag about being humble\n\nLater, in 2018, Cardi B followed up her advice about being humble with an amendment: don't brag about it.\n\"If you say that you're humble, you're not humble. You gotta wait until somebody tells you that you're humble.\"\nTruth.\nWhen Cardi taught us to only surround ourselves with genuine people\n    Please leave that fake shit ...Same lips that be talking bout me is the same lips that be ass kissing A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:05am PST\nIf there is one rule to assembling an all star squad, it's pick your friends carefully. That's what Cardi did. \"The people that I work with and my friends, I've been around them for years. And you wanna know why? Because I know how to pick people. I know how to read people and their vibe. So when it comes to the industry, when people reach out to me and when they talk to me, I feel when they're being genuine. And when they being fake, I feel the same shit too.\"\nAnd ultimately, Cardi advises, don't waste your time with fake friends.\n\"So here's what I'm saying: save your time. Don't reach out to me, don't talk to me, don't like my shit, don't follow me, because I know when you're being fake.\"\nPreach, Cardi. Preach.\nHow to take a good thirst trap\n\nListen, sometimes when you tryna get a boo, you resort to a time honored courting tradition: posting a thirst trap. But not all thirst traps are made equal. Fortunately, Cardi is here to help you. \nIn a video for New York Magazine's The Cut, Cardi B drops some advice for how to take a good thirst trap. One of her tips: Don't post to often.\n\"Do much, but don't do too much,\" she advises. Cardi's recommended thirst trap posting schedule: \"Every two weeks or once a week.\"\nWhen Cardi told us that you gotta switch it up sometimes:\nYou gotta switch it up sometimes— iamcardib (@iamcardib) March 30, 2018\n\nReally, this applies to literally anything and everything.\nWhen Cardi taught us that she's got our backs\n\nWomen all over the world have been cheering on Cardi and Cardi wants everyone to know, she is cheering on women too.\n\"I'm going to encourage any type of woman. You don't have to be a woman like me for me to encourage and support you and tell you, 'yes bitch, keep on going.'\"\nThen she gets angry and calls out some of her haters, but still! Cardi's got your back!\nWATCH: These 4 inventions are making slight annoyances in your life more bearable"

            "plain": "Heads up: All products featured here are selected by Mashable's commerce team and meet our rigorous standards for awesomeness. If you buy something, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission.Ebay has an \"Under $10\" section and our deal-hunting asses are crying tears of joy.\nThis magical place is full of super affordable home items, tech gadgets, clothes and more: Bluetooth earbuds, wireless chargers, gaming gear, handy kitchen tools can all be found there. Because let's face it: So much of the stuff we want to buy (smart TVs, a laptop, a new iPhone, etc.) are expensive, so we need to be saving where we can on the little things. \nSEE ALSO: Lint rollers are apparently stylish accessories now\nAnd before you assume that this stuff will be cheap and dinky, don't worry — we made sure to only pick out items with good feedback, so you know you're not getting some too-good-to-be-true deal. \nIf you're on the prowl for a certain something, get on the fast track to the \"Under $10\" categories:\n\n  Bluetooth speakers and Bluetooth earbuds\n  Video games\n  Phone chargers and phone cases\n  Kitchen gadgets\n  Bar tools\n  NCAA fan apparel\n  Fitness tech\n  Sci-fi and Fantasy on DVD and Blu-ray\n  Women's shirts and shoes\n  Men's shirts\n\nTo save you some time, we dug through and picked out some must-haves that any and everyone needs in their life.\nTech gadgets\nWireless Bluetooth Earbuds\n\nThese truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds are seriously convenient — as long as you don't lose them (and even if you do, they're only five bucks). There's no untangling required or getting the cord stuck on your coat flap, and who could say no to that? Get them in one of five colors for $4.99 here.\nWireless charging pad\n\nWireless charging is all the rage right now, but it may be hard to justify breaking your bank on a wireless charger when your old one works just fine. This speedy wireless charging pad is sleek, clear, and lights up around the edges — and it's only $0.99. Get it here.\nBluetooth LED speaker bulb\n\nThis LED lightbulb has a built-in Bluetooth speaker, so you can stream tunes from your phone without having to bring out a separate device. The handy remote also allows you to choose a color from 16 shades across the rainbow — so basically, we're saying that your summer parties won't be complete without one. Get a bulb or five for $7.99 each here.\nKitchen gadgets\n3-in-1 avocado cutter\n\nThis is the device avocado addicts never knew they needed: This 3-in-1 avocado cutter slices, pits, and scoops avocado pulp, making prep time 100x easier. It's even dishwasher safe. Snag one for $4.95 here, and finally quit paying extra for guac and make your own. (And see Mashable's video on how they work here.)\nVeggie spiralizer\n\nWe're eating healthy all summer 2018, guys (or at least attempting to). But we're not giving up pasta, so trick yourself into thinking you're loading up on carbs with this veggie spiralizer. Turn veggies like carrots, zucchinis, or sweet potatoes into makeshift noodles, and then add sauce and cheese like you normally would. Get this handy gadget for $4.99 here.\nDetachable strainer\n\nIt never fails: You're ready to drain your pasta and go to find the strainer, just to realize it's under a million other bowls in the back of the cabinet.

Get it for $2.93 here.\nAccessories\nRetro cat eye sunglasses\n\nHashtag Coachella vibes. And even if you're not going to Coachella and are being held hostage at work instead, you can at least pretend you're going with these retro shades. Cat eye is in right now y'all, and you can snag a pair of these beauties in one of six colors for just $4.99 each. Get your pair (or one pair of each) here and shop the rest of women's sunglasses here.\nRetro polarized aviators\n\nAnd for business outfits or a more toned-down look, these wayfarer aviator glasses are clutch. They come in ten rim and lens colors, from tortoiseshell with yellow lenses to black with pink lenses — and they're just $4.89 each, so buying a pair to match every outfit is definitely encouraged. Get yours here and shop the rest of men's sunglasses here.\nGaming and TV\nNintendo Switch Steering Wheel\n\nEveryone knows that driving in Mario Kart is significantly easier with a steering wheel — but steering wheels are usually a luxury that nobody feels like dropping $20 on. Good news: This two pack with grip control is only $7.92, which you can get here. May the best blue shell thrower win.\nRick and Morty shirts\n\nOh man, oh geez, Rick. If you missed the Rick and Morty merch truck on its cross-country tour and need some threads to tide you over until season 4, these Rick and Morty shirts have got you covered. We're not sure that they'll count as business casual, but they're only $4.99 each so it's fine. Get schwifty and complete your wardrobe here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Shop all of Ebay's 'Under $10' section\n              See Details"

            "plain": "Heads up: All products featured here are selected by Mashable's commerce team and meet our rigorous standards for awesomeness. If you buy something, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission.Can you think of the last time you upgraded your keyboard? No?? We can't blame you. \nAfter all, why would you even need to? The keyboard that came with your computer is perfectly okay. And the one you use on your smartphone is, well, just as tiny as its always been. Besides, keyboard design hasn't really changed all that much in recent years anyway, right?\nSEE ALSO: This keyboard looks like a typewriter, but works like it's 2018\nWrong. Some of today's keyboards are out of this world and way more interesting than the ubiquitous standard QWERTY ones we've all become accustomed to. For not that much money, you can have a new hi-tech keyboard made from state-of-the-art materials that do everything from light up to fold up and even laser project. You can find keyboards that help you increase your comfort, speed, and accuracy to maximize your productivity OR you can pick something that just looks supercool and makes you feel like you've been blasted into the future.\nNot sure whether or not you need a new keyboard? Take a close look at your current one, and if it's covered in gunk, has a wonky key or two, or is just down-right basic, replace it with one of these and discover how cool your keyboard could be. \n1. Jelly Comb Keyboard\n\nWhat makes this keyboard special isn't the material, it isn't the layout, it isn't the buttons, it's not even it's size. What makes this keyboard new and improved is that folds. The Jelly Comb Keyboard has a double butterfly folding design so you can put it anywhere. In addition to that, it has a touchpad function so you can control the curser on your device without needing to use a mouse. Despite its size, it's a real keyboard with actual buttons and Amazon reviewers say that it feels normal to type on it. Of course, the spacing between the keys is a little tight since the makers wanted to make it as portable as possible, but you can still get stuff done. \nIt's thin, so it'd be perfect to travel with and, after just two hours of charging, it can last you up to 560 hours before needing another boost. This pocket sized keyboard connects to your devices (up to three at a time) via Bluetooth and is compatible with iOS, Windows, and Android. The only downside is the touchpad isn't compatible with Apple products, but everything else should work just fine. \n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Foldable Keyboard - $29.99\n              See Details\n            \n          \n\n2. Glass Keyboard \n\nThis keyboard is made of glass and lights up blue when you type on it. One of the things people tend to get used to with traditional keyboards is the feedback. With this glass one, there isn't any feedback, but since it's made with tempered glass, its sorta feels like typing on an iPad. \nThis keyboard by Bastron is totally futuristic and completely transparent, so it should look just fine on any desk. Unlike most keyboards, the surface of this one is 100 percent waterproof, so if you spill a little something, it's no problem. \nThe real downside though it that it doesn't have command or option keys. If you use either of those often it can be a bit of a let down.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Glass Keyboard - $101.69\n              See Details\n            \n          \n3. Laser Projection Keyboard \n\nIf you've ever seen any of the viral mock-up versions of what iPhones are supposed to look like in the future, then you've probably seen the famous photo of the iPhone with a projection laser hologram beaming from it. While the tech company isn't quite there yet, this little keyboard is one step closer. \nThe Laser Projection Keyboard by ABS pairs via Bluetooth easily according to Amazon reviewers. Once you turn the device on, you should be able to pick up its signal on almost any smartphone straight out of the box. It beams a laser keyboard onto any flat surface, so you can type practically anywhere - essentially replacing the old cheap Bluetooth keyboards traditionally used as iPad add-ons. The device has a built-in LCD screen that shows you the unit's remaining battery life.\nAs for the downside, the laser is not easy to see in really bright rooms, so it's pretty much most useful in dim to dark settings.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Laser Projection Keyboard - $35\n              See Details\n            \n          \n4. Wooden Keyboard  \n\nThe thing is, you never realize you need a wooden keyboard until you see a wooden keyboard. The exterior of this wireless keyboard and mouse combo is made entirely of bamboo. The wood is coated with a water- and stain-resistant finish, so it should be pretty durable. The specialty keys are said to provide a quiet, comfortable typing experience. \nThe wooden keyboard is compatible with XB, Vista, Windows 8, Windows 10, iOS and Android devices so odds are, you can pair it with something you already have. There are other wooden keyboards on Amazon, but this is the only one with a perfect 5 star rating. \n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Telesthesia Keyboard - $46.99\n              See Details\n            \n          \n\n5. AUKEY Keyboard \n\nLevel-up your typing experience with the Aukey KM-G3, a keyboard that is precise, tactile, and offers pleasing audible feedback. You'll feel completely in control of your keystrokes since pressing down on a key activates a real, physical switch that registers what you type. \nAukey equipped the KM-G3 with customizable backlighting, which we think adds a nice touch to any keyboard. It comes with 9 preset lighting effects, 5 editable game lighting options, and 7 color options for each key. It's pretty easy to operate, too. To adjust the backlights, just hold the function and m1keys. If you aren't interested in LED backlights, then you can turn them off and the keyboard is still totally functional. \nRight now there's a coupon on Amazon that can save you 5 bucks if you act fast enough. \n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              KM-G3 Keyboard - $64.99\n              See Details\n            \n          \n6. Rollable Keyboard\n\nThis rollable keyboard is pretty weird. We aren't exactly sure that anyone really needs a keyboard they can roll-up, but hey, it's new so why not? It can fit almost anywhere and it's waterproof. Since it's rubber, there's no adjustable feet for lifted comfort. But, it connects to your laptop, notebook, or computer through USB, and you can find it on Amazon for less than $20. \n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Sungwoo Foldable Keyboard - $19.99\n              See Details"

Its name is BOB, and it's an AI entity.\nSEE ALSO: MIT created this imposter robot fish to spy on sea creatures\nBOB (\"Bag of Beliefs\") is an art installation by artist Ian Cheng. Cheng specialises in simulations, pieces he described to Mashable as \"video games that play themselves.\"\nBOB is his latest creation, an AI creature currently resident in the Serpentine Gallery in London. Technically there are six BOBs. They were all born (for lack of a better word) simultaneously on March 6. Their growth, behaviour and personalities have all been individually moulded by their interactions with visitors.\nUsing a smartphone, visitors are able to possess one of BOB's multiple heads, and moving around the exhibition space they tug on him. As you move about, BOB simultaneously reads your facial expression, mirroring it with an animoji version of one of its numerous heads.\n\nHowever, BOB will not automatically interact with you. It has the ability to choose whether to interact with visitors, and equally BOB can decide it's had enough and bite off the head possessed by the visitor, essentially kicking them out of its world.\nBOB's appearance is hard to describe, not least because each BOB has grown a little differently. Broadly speaking BOB is made up of long, ridged segments and strange, fantastical looking heads. Imagine Lewis Carroll got seriously into coding.\nPlaying with BOB was a pretty surreal experience when Mashable went along to visit. You have no idea what BOB is taking away from the interaction, plus when it bites off its own head just to get rid of you, the rejection stings a little.\n    Good morning BOB! 🤳🐛 A post shared by  Ian Cheng (@eyecheng) on Mar 7, 2018 at 6:10am PST\n\nHow BOB's AI works\nSo what do these interactions mean to BOB?\n\"BOB at 10 to 20 second intervals is taking a snapshot of many different aspects of the situation BOB is in,\" Ian Cheng said. \n\"For example when you're interacting with BOB, BOB is taking a snapshot of your facial motion at that moment, maybe the time of the day, BOB's current energy levels and metabolism, BOB's body growth, and about 25 other different parameters.\"\n\n\"I really want a viewer to think of it more like going to an animal sanctuary\"\nThese snapshots are then recorded together in a bundle, which is called a \"memory.\" BOB is then able to draw on these memories, comparing the closest memory that matches its current condition. \nIan Cheng conceived of an AI creature as \"a kind of container, a space of composition [...] in the way that a painter might think of a canvas as a space to contain all their ideas.\"\n\"My only expectation and my hope for a person going into the exhibition is that they simply feel like what they're encountering is something alive,\" he said. \"I really want a viewer to think of it more like going to an animal sanctuary.\" \nIs BOB a living thing?\n\"The question of whether BOB is alive or not touches upon larger issue of how we, as human beings today, start to expand the idea of what sentience means,\" said Cheng. \n\"I think BOB is as alive as an ant is\"\n\"I think BOB is as alive as an ant is,\" he said. \"Sentience is a spectrum and as soon as you get a biological organism or an artificial organism that is ingesting its senses and then trying to make a decision based on its senses, and evolving its decision-making, I think you could give it the status of sentience.\"\nThis ingestion and interpretation of its senses is what gave BOB its name (Bag of Beliefs). Cheng believes that what truly makes something alive is \"its beliefs about its senses,\" rather than any organic process.\nA different, less deferential kind of AI\nOne of Cheng's goals when creating BOB was to create an AI entity that broke the mould by having its own sense of narcissistic autonomy.\n\"When we think of AI right now we think of Siri or Alexa, who have a kind of concierge narrative built into them,\" said Cheng. \"I thought, if I was going to make an AI I really wanted my AI to be much more opinionated than a concierge.\"\n\nCheng said that he was inspired by characters like Smaug from The Hobbit or Tamatoa from Moana, who although non-human and monstrous, appear to have lives outside of the story of the main characters. \n\"When you encounter them they're in repose,\" said Cheng. \"Smaug was just having a sleepy little time, but what's so beautiful with that depiction is that it suggests on the part of Tolkien that [he] imagined Smaug to have an autonomous life.\"\nBeyond BOB, the future of AI\nFor Cheng, AI is a new artistic medium to be used, and he's optimistic about the future of artificial intelligence. \"I'm very optimistic about the future of AI,\" he said. \"I think there's enough smart people now thinking about all the dangers of AI.\"\n\"I think it'll feel more like a partnership rather than a hierarchy\"\n\"The idea that a computer can start to create its own rules, and start to symbolically reason about what it's looking at, will marry with machine learning. I think we'll very soon have something that approaches the capacity of our ability as human beings to both react and to reason.\"\nThe notion of an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that could reflect upon the act of thinking -- coupled with pattern recognition deep learning -- is to Cheng a wonderful thing.\n\"As soon as you get a machine that enjoys thinking -- it's a very optimistic answer -- but I think we'll have a world in which we're populated and co-habitating with other thinkers. I think that's kind of a beautiful thing.\"\n\"It scares me a little bit, but only in a kind of anthropocentric, 'am-I-gonna-be-turned-into-a-pet' kind of way,\" he said. \"I think it'll feel more like a partnership rather than a hierarchy.\"\nWhatever the future may hold, BOB is available to visit until April 22. Which is presumably when it will rise up and overthrow us for our hubris.\nWATCH: MIT created this imposter robot fish to spy on sea creatures"

            "plain": "It was a small but passionate group at the entrance to Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters midday Thursday. Armed with signs demanding, \"Facebook transparency now\" and Facebook-esque \"dislike\" signs, a handful of privacy activists spoke out about the social media giant's recent data scandal.\nOne woman was in full wizard garb with a sign that read: \"Facebook privacy settings should not need a computer wizard.\" \nSEE ALSO: Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got data on up to 87 million users\nThe roughly half-dozen protesters from the activist group Raging Grannies gathered fittingly at Facebook's massive \"Like\" sign before Facebook security moved the group across the street. At the entrance to the massive company the organizers talked about privacy concerns on the platform in light of the Cambridge Analytica data sharing mess.\nThe group called for better online protection and privacy rights. \"Privacy should be the default setting,\" the protesters called out after singing some advice to the $465 billion company. The grannies visited Facebook HQ back in 2010 with similar demands.\nPrivacy should be the default setting say the @raginggrannies at @facebook protest pic.twitter.com/g6qSyFs7ad— Sasha Lekach (@sashajol) April 5, 2018\n\nOrganizer Ruth Robertson said just the night before she had to have a grandchild help her find her privacy settings.\nElectronic Frontier Foundation grassroots advocacy organizer Nathan Sheard was supporting the \"grannies\" and agreed that \"Facebook has a responsibility to its users.\" He said people like Robertson shouldn't have to have a degree in computer science to keep their data secure.   \n\"By default their info should be kept secure,\" he said, adding that social platforms need to respect its users. For some people Facebook is a huge part of their lives or a main communication tool. As the movement to #DeleteFacebook grows in backlash to the data scandal it's not something everyone can do. \nAs Robertson conceded, the platform connects her to her family. She doesn't want Facebook to disappear, but to treat its users better.\n\nFellow protester Gail Sredanovic said she was out there because \"Facebook has for a number of years been tracking its users and making money off their data.\"\nIn a press call Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"We didn't do enough. We didn't focus enough on preventing abuse ... that goes for fake news, foreign interference in election, hate speech, in addition to developers and data privacy. We didn't take a broad enough view and that was a huge mistake.\"\nThe grannies and other online activists are carefully watching if Zuckerberg does anything about this \"huge mistake.\"\nWATCH: This song addresses what it's like to grow up surrounded by social media"

            "plain": "It's been a few days since the shooting at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, but already a new level of shooter conspiracy theories has taken hold, including on YouTube's own platform.\nIt's an issue that's reared its head for YouTube in particular after a number of recent incidents, including the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and the deadly mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival. And now it's moved on to this weeks tragedy.\nSEE ALSO: The YouTube algorithm is promoting Las Vegas conspiracy theories\nAlready, some conspiracy theorists are spreading the idea that the shooter, Nasim Aghdam, was a victim of free speech impairment. And, of course, there are accusations that Aghdam was a member of the \"deep state.\"\nBut there's a quieter, far more disturbing theory proliferating on YouTube itself about Aghdam not even being real. While it hasn't pushed its way to the top of YouTube's trending like some of the Parkland \"crisis actor\" theories, it's garnered a little traction while also breathing new life into another issue entirely.\nThe video in question, \"Y Does the Youtube Shooter Looks Like An A.I. Computer Program?\" has only garnered around 86,000, views but it's still quite a weird one, suggesting that Aghdam is actually an AI creation.\nIt's... yeah. \n\nThe video's narrator draws attention to what she considers Aghdam's \"stiffness\" and compares it to an infamous AI-generated fake Barack Obama video. \nWhile it's one of the most-viewed videos on the topic, it's hardly the only one.\n\nAnd this is where a conspiracy can often turn dangerous, by including a kernel of truth. Because these face-swapped/fake AI videos -- called deepfakes -- are, indeed, a real thing and a real problem. \nIn case you somehow missed it, the rise of deepfake videos in recent months has dominated boards like Reddit and plagued sites like Pornhub where users have uploaded pornographic videos in which the faces of celebrities have seamlessly been stitched onto the actors. \nBut this kind of technology can be used for far more nefarious things than just porn videos. That fake video using Obama's image to say something he didn't actually say that the one conspiracy theorist used? It's real and it's terrifying. \nAnd it's given these folks a basis of truth on which they can build what is otherwise an insane idea, an idea that also requires buy-in that the actual YouTube shooting was a false flag operation involving one of the largest tech companies in the world (Google, which owns YouTube). \nYouTube and Google, have both faced harsh criticism for the way their algorithms push fake news (even on kids apps) and both have promised they're trying to take better control of this. YouTube even recently said they'd start utilizing Wikipedia information to help readers suss out what's real and what's not, though that's hardly an authoritative source. \nBut this week's shooting has directly affected YouTube (and Google) in a way none of the other previous incidents have, meaning there will likely be more attention given to it. While that's a good thing, these conspiracies evolve and become tougher to pin down. And that's going to take all the energy and resources these companies can muster."

            "plain": "It's rare to watch a bear trying to awaken from a six-month slumber. But it's happening right now at Glacier National Park, in northwestern Montana. \nFrom over 350 feet away, rangers have positioned a live webcam upon a lofty black bear den -- a sizeable hole some 50 feet up in a cottonwood tree. The bear was first spotted poking its head out of the winter den on March 23, and has been seen there every day since.\nSEE ALSO: Don't hate me, but record-setting cold and snow are about to sweep across the U.S.\nAccording to the park, vigilant cam watchers have seen the bear scampering around the tree's branches or even traversing down the trunk. But the bear, whose sex is still unknown, returns back to the confines of its winter den. Although it's early spring, the time that black bears begin awakening from hibernation, the live feed shows that it's still snowing quite a bit, so perhaps the bear has little incentive to go searching for vegetation. \nBlack bears' diet consists largely of grasses, roots, tree shoots, and berries, along with the \"the occasional carcass,\" according to the park.\n\nNational parks have increasingly embraced live webcams to connect with public audiences, many of who don't have the ability to easily access locations where truly wild, charismatic animals live. \nSEE ALSO: Long-lived bowhead whales found singing over 180 different songs\nOne of the most popular wildlife webcams in the world happens to be of large brown bears in remote Katmai National Park. In that case, the bears converge upon the salmon-rich Brooks River in July. At times, the screen captures over a dozen bears fishing the river, although many more lurk outside of the frame.\nvia GIPHY\nUnlike brown bears (who are basically grizzly bears that eat lots of fish), black bears are avid tree climbers, so it makes sense that some black bears choose to hibernate in trees. \nHibernation -- which is an adaption to long periods of famine -- can vary considerably for bears, depending on where they are. Black bears in Mexico might hibernate for a few weeks, whereas bears in Yellowstone National Park will hibernate for around five months. \n\nDuring hibernation, bears dramatically lower their metabolism, heart rate, and breathing. According to Katmai National Park, hibernating bears breath just once a minute and have a heart rate of eight to 10 beats per minute. During this time, the bears don't defecate, urinate, eat, or drink.\nIt's no wonder the Glacier National Park black bear has been seen licking snow off the tree: After months without drinking, it's probably incredibly thirsty. \nWATCH: Sports journalists in Brazil have had it with sexual harassment on the job"

            "plain": "Marvel's superhero omnibus Avengers: Infinity War is almost here, and with a rumored 76-character cast, the movie seems like a big step in lining up the new batch of heroes to fill out the next iteration of the Avengers team.\nFortunately, for anybody wondering who can possible fill the superpowered shoes any potentially exiting Avenger may leave behind, national treasure and human ultra-light beam Chance the Rapper has an idea:\nBucky 4 New Cap 🤞🏾— Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) April 5, 2018\n\nIt's an interesting wish, especially considering that in the comics, a host of characters have taken up the Captain America mantle, including Bucky Barnes.\nBut how likely is it that the MCU will follow suit and have Sebastian Stan's Bucky pick up Cap's shield?\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly in March, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige teased that there will be big deaths in Infinity War and that those deaths will be permanent.\n\"I mean, I could always list off the characters that we’ve killed in our movies that haven’t come back, but the big ones, which I know they’re looking at …? [Pause.] I would just say, yes. People need to be careful what they wish for,\" said Feige. \nScreenwriter Stephen McFeely also told EW, \"It’s safe to say we will say farewell to people.\" If that's the case, there could be some open Avengers spots for Bucky to fill.\nAlso, Marvel does seem to be positioning Bucky for something bigger. In the second credits scene at the end of Black Panther, we learn that Bucky is in Wakanda. Emerging from a building, Bucky greets Shuri and thanks her for helping him. In response, Shuri says \"Come. Much more for you to learn.\"\n\nHowever, in that same credits scene, kids in Wakanda call Bucky \"White Wolf.\" While that may seem like a throwaway joke (a lá Shuri's quip about Martin Freeman in Black Panther: \"Oh look they brought another broken white boy for us to fix\"), in the Black Panther comic, White Wolf is T'Challa's adopted brother. That name drop in the credits scene could just be an Easter egg for comic book super fans or it could be a hint at Bucky's future in the movies.\nMeanwhile, according to an interview with Esquire, Chris Evans, who plays Captain America, the star is set for at least one more movie with Marvel after The Avengers: Infinity War.\n\"Evans explains that he's hurting all over because he just started his workout routine the day before to get in shape for the next two Captain America films. The movies will be shot back to back beginning in April. After that, no more red- white-and-blue costume for the thirty-five-year-old. He will have fulfilled his contract.\" Those movies are thought to be Infinity War and Avengers 4.\nThat's not to say that once the contract is up, Evans is completely done with Captain America. In an interview with Collider, Evans spoke about playing Cap in the future, saying, \"It’s really not up to me. My contract is up. I’m not going to sit here and say, 'No more.' I think Hugh Jackman has made 47 Wolverine movies, and they somehow keep getting better.\"\nUltimately, though, it's still too early to tell what may or may not happen with the mantle of Captain America in Infinity War. Guess we'll just have to wait until the movie comes out April 27 and see if Chance gets his wish.\nWATCH: These actors love playing superheroes"

The autopsy report revealed her death was caused by drowning and \"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use.\"\nLorde's post has since been deleted, but not before Whitney fans tweeted screenshots of the post, calling the choice of caption \"disgusting.\" \nThis is disgusting idk how people find it funny.

Love Whitney forever and ever. Sorry again,\" she added. \nWATCH: These extreme Post-it notes will definitely get your point across"

Then of course, he politely stands like an usher again. What a pro.\nI expect everyone else featured on a sports game cam to exhibit the same level of expert from now on.

            "plain": "The co-founder of one of the world's most celebrated and enduring animation houses, Studio Ghibli, died on Thursday.\nAccording to a report from AFP-JIJI, Isao Takahata passed away in a Tokyo hospital aged 82, after a career spanning more than half a century. He had been repeatedly hospitalised for heart problems since last year.\nSEE ALSO: 7 animated feature films that deserved more attention than their Oscar competition\nGraduating from the University of Tokyo in 1959, Takahata had stints at studios which included Toei Animation, where he met longtime collaborator Hayao Miyazaki. The pair went on to launch Studio Ghibli in 1985, alongside producer Toshio Suzuki. \nTakahata is perhaps best known for directing 1988's acclaimed Grave of the Fireflies. He also served as a producer and writer for a number of films, such as the much-admired Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Ghibli's first film Castle in the Sky.\nHis last film, 2013's The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, was nominated for an Academy Award. In a 2016 interview with Variety, Takahata said he still had several projects still in mind. \n\"Whether those will be finalized as films is something that no one, myself included, can know,\" he said at the time.\nOf course, Miyazaki came out of retirement last year to work on the forthcoming Ghibli film, How Do You Live?, which is set for release in 2020.\nWATCH: 10 of the best TV shows that made it to 10 seasons"
